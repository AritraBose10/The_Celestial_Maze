âš¡ Puzzle #8: The Celestial Maze
Welcome, Digital Shilpi. You have pierced the veil of creation and arrived at the digital forge's coreâ€”a celestial maze of cosmic realms. The path to the Vajra's true energy is hidden within this complex network, but a single sacred verse will guide your hand.

Normal navigation will lead you astray. Follow the path described in the verse below to find the correct folder at each step of your journey.

The Sacred Verse
The path to the astra's core is not found in the abyss, nor on mortal ground, but in the realm of the gods.

There, seek not tales of war or fate, but the chamber where their divine gifts await.

The key was not given by the Preserver or the Destroyer, but by the King of Devas, the wielder of lightning.

Follow the path of the thunderbolt itself, and you will find what you seek.

Your Mission
Read the Verse: Carefully read each line of the verse above. Each line is a clue to the next folder you must enter.

Navigate the Maze: Follow the instructions precisely by clicking through the folders.

Find the File: At the end of the correct path, you will find a file named final_key.txt. Its content is the Energy Key you seek.

ðŸ’¡ Hint
The titles "Preserver" and "Destroyer" are famous epithets for two of the most powerful gods in the Hindu pantheon. Identifying them will help you eliminate the incorrect paths in the final stage of the maze.
